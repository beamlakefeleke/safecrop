    "Suggestion4":"Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that suck plant sap, weakening plants and potentially spreading other diseases. They are often found in clusters on the underside of leaves.",
    "Suggestion4a":"Inspect maize fields regularly, paying close attention to the underside of leaves where aphids often cluster.",
    "Suggestion4b":"Recommended Insecticides",
